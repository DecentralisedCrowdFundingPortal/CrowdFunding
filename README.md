<h1> Trusted Crowdfunding Platform using Blockchain </h1>

<h3> Aim: </h3>
<p> To build a safe, secure, and transparent crowdfunding platform using blockchain technology. </P>

<h3>
  Problem Statement:
</h3>

<p>
Crowdfunding is a way of supporting a project or business endeavor through a large number of individual contributions, generally online. The problem with the current crowdfunding sites is that they don’t provide contributors with a sense of trust and clients don’t have control over the money they donate/invest. There is a strong need for a transparent and reliable platform to attract donators by bringing trust among them. Contributors are unaware of the fact - what exactly happens with their money and is it even used for the intended purpose? Hence, there is a big gap between clients and crowdfunding organizations that needs to be bridged.
</p>

<h3>
Why we are using Blockchain?
</h3>

<p>
Blockchain technology will offer a risk-free, transparent, and secure method for crowdfunding. It has interactive forms so that contributors and campaign designers may both easily start and finance initiatives. The donor would be able to monitor the progress of the funds they are donating. All transactions will be recorded and stored as blocks on the Blockchain. The transaction history will be visible to all the contributors and without the approval of the majority of donators, the fundraiser cannot cash in the funds. The purposed system is made transparent, trustworthy, and secure via blockchain. The project intends to help the creators and donors to increase funding and achieve a high level of trust among them.

<h3>
Solution:
</h3>

<p>
To solve this problem we are building a smart contract between fundraisers and contributors based on the mutual agreement of both parties. This contract will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and will be live all over the world. Each contributor will have a separate copy of the contract and can see every transaction which has happened. The total duration of an event, total money raised, and required money for the purpose will also be in the public domain. So, blockchain will provide the best solution for both contributors and fundraising organizations.
</p>

<h3>
Implementation:
</h3>

<p>
For the implementation of the project, we have performed the following steps:

1)Build a smart contract using solidity to fulfill the specific conditions which are agreed upon by both fundraisers and contributors.

2)Deployment of the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using a hardhat development environment.

3)Develop a client-side interface (web app) for the transparency of the client. This app will contain various pages such as the home page, creating a campaign, campaign details, etc. We will use react framework for the front-end development.
